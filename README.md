## General
This repository was created for the purpose of our Reproducible Research class.

The task specification to complete the course were as follows:

1. Take an econometric / statistical analysis from Kaggle
We've decided to replicate the [Avocado Price Prediction project published on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anitha136/avocado-price-prediction)

2. Translate the codes to a different programming language. Reproduce the results.
The code was translated from python to R. 

3. Update the data.
The Kaggle project was then updated by the [most recent avocado price data from 2018 to 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/timmate/avocado-prices-2020). 

4. Discuss the findings and conclusions.
The differences and similarities between the replication on old data and new data were discussed. 
Moreover, the use of R vs python was examined. 

## Documentation

The repository consists of two folders, additional files, this README file and ".gitigonre" folder.
* The "translated_code_with_new_data" folder consists of translated code + new dataset, containing 2018-2020 data in .csv and .Rdata.
* In "translated_code_with_old_data" folder one can find the original python code, translated code in R, original dataset, in two formats (.csv and .Rdata.). 
* The .qmd file in the main section contains code for presentation
* The created presentaion is then stored as .pptx
